PROCESS REPORT

Overall, I thought this homework was really interesting and useful. There is so much data on the web, and having the skills  to pull it out and manipulate it freely opens so many doors, and really changes the landscape of data collection.

For the purposes of this homework and easing myself into the world of scraping and APIs, I chose to scrape data on average temperature in Canada from Wikipedia, and use an API with Twitter to analyse sentiment in rain-related tweets.

Here is a link to my [rendered hw10 md file](https://github.com/vmichalowski/STAT545-hw-Michalowski-Victoria/blob/master/hw10%20-%20scraping%20and%20APIs/hw10.md).

I had a few challenges come up in this homework - for setting up my twitter API, I constantly got an error message and couldn't get the authentication to work. I ultimately had to upgrade R to the latest version for it to work, which was fine since I'm sure that it's best practice to work with the most up to date version anyways. And then cleaning the data is also challenging, since it's always a different problem with the character data that needs to be solved. However, there are several message boards on Stack Overflow and going through the documentation for the packages also really helped.

The most exciting thing for me about getting data off the web is learning how much is out there, and the sheer efficiency of data collection that comes with scraping. I also thought it was really cool so many websites offer APIs for developers - for example, Spotify even provides features for every song it has, so that you can pull out things like "liveliness" or whatever for each song. It would be interesting to compare their features with your own sentiment analysis to see how they compare.

I guess the biggest question that I've been mulling over while doing this homework is how we have so much data on people who use the web, and are willing to share their information over platforms like twitter. But this still doesn't give us any insights into people or things that do not have a public internet presence. So despite the depths of data scraping, I don't think it would be accurate to say, for instance, that we know what everyone's feelings about rain are - just everyone who is vocal about it on Twitter. I'm not sure to what extent that's an issue for data scraped off the web.
