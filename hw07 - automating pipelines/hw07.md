For this assignment, I was having trouble downloading the gapminder data from the detailed instructions of the assignment, so I went to the gapminder website (<http://www.gapminder.org/data/>) looking for the original source, and found that they have many different kinds of worldwide data sets. I decided to choose one on CO2 emissions across different countries in the world.

The first step remained to download the data. To do this, I uploaded the data on to my github repo first.
