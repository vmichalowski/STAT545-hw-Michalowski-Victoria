PROCESS REPORT

Here is a link to my r package repo, [powersexpanded](https://github.com/vmichalowski/powersexpanded). You can find information about how to install and use it there in the [readme file](https://github.com/vmichalowski/powersexpanded/blob/master/README.md) there.

As you might be able to guess from the package name, I focused on trying to extend the powers example we did in class for this assignment.

I think the biggest challenge was trying to understand the organization of the package, in that there are a lot of seperate folders and scripts necessary to build a package, unlike in past homework, where you can usually get most parts of your assignment done in one R markdown file. However, it became more clear to me as I worked through the assignment what all the components did and how to put them together. I still don't totally have my head wrapped around test_that, but it was helpful to look through the [documentation for this package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) and learn about the different types of expect functions.
