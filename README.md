# Introduction

Hello! My name is Victoria Michalowski.

I'm a **3rd year PhD student** in [Health Psychology](http://psych.ubc.ca/research/health/).

- A large part of what I do is quantitative, and involves big data sets, so I'm excited to learn how to make my statistical analyses cleaner, reproducible, and easier to share with collaborators using R and GitHub. I'm looking forward to learn how to be more efficient and fluent in my coding.


# Report of my process

To get the changes into README.md on GitHub, I created a project and copied my GitHub repository link into R Studio. From files in the bottom-right corner window, I selected the README.md, and then pulled, edited locally using R Studio markdown, saved, committed, and pushed back to GitHub.

I initially created a new markdown file and tried to push that into GitHub, expecting that it would change the README.md file in the repository, until I realized that I had to selected the README.md file from the files tab, and open that up as my markdown file in R Studio - things made much more sense after that. Before I realized this, I had created and deleted a couple repositories, thinking it would be easier to start from scratch, in case there was something weird happening being the scenes that I couldn't see. However, I now see that this is a really poor solution for problems in the future when working with collaborators, but I also think it will be easier to see what is going wrong now that I better understand how R Studio and GitHub communicate.

Even though deleting my repository in GitHub was a horrible way to approach problems, it also meant that I was starting over a lot, and simply repeating the steps a lot. In the end, it became natural to know how to create a new repository, create a new project, and work between R Studio and GitHub.

I was also using knit to see whether my code was working at first, but I found that it was much easier to see what was going wrong when I ran lines of code individually in the console, and then put them into R markdown when I was satisfied that I wanted to use that code.

This is my [rendered .md for the Gapminder exploration](https://github.com/vmichalowski/STAT545-hw-Michalowski-Victoria/blob/master/hw01%20-%20repo%2C%20readme.md%2C%20r%20markdown/Gapminder_Data_Exploration.md).
